1.	Understand Sorting Algorithms:
Explain different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
Sorting algorithms are essential for organizing data, and each algorithm has its own characteristics and use cases. Here’s an overview of some common sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
Algorithm Overview:
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) - When the list is already sorted (optimized version).
Average Case: O(n^2) - Comparisons and swaps are made in quadratic time.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the list is in reverse order.

Space Complexity:
O(1) - Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm.
Use Case:
Suitable for small datasets or educational purposes due to its simplicity.

2. Insertion Sort
Algorithm Overview:
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It picks elements from the unsorted part and inserts them into the correct position in the sorted part of the array.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) - When the list is already sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2) - Requires quadratic time due to comparisons and shifts.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the list is in reverse order.

Space Complexity:
O(1) - Insertion Sort is also an in-place sorting algorithm.
Use Case:
Effective for small or partially sorted datasets. Often used as part of more complex algorithms.

3. Quick Sort
Algorithm Overview:
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a ‘pivot’ element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, which are then sorted recursively. Elements less than the pivot go to one side, and elements greater than the pivot go to the other.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n) - When the pivot divides the array into approximately equal halves.
Average Case: O(n log n) - Typically, Quick Sort performs well in practice.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the pivot is the smallest or largest element (e.g., when the array is already sorted).

Space Complexity:
O(log n) - Due to the recursion stack.
Use Case:
Quick Sort is highly efficient for large datasets and is often used in practice for its average-case performance and lower overhead.

4. Merge Sort
Algorithm Overview:
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n) - The performance is consistent regardless of the initial order of elements.
Average Case: O(n log n) - Same as the best case.
Worst Case: O(n log n) - Performance remains consistent even in the worst case.

Space Complexity:
O(n) - Requires additional space for merging.
Use Case:
Ideal for large datasets and situations where stable sorting (preserving the relative order of equal elements) is required.

4.	Analysis:
Compare the performance (time complexity) of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort

Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) - When the list is already sorted (optimized version).
Average Case: O(n^2) - The algorithm makes comparisons and swaps in quadratic time.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the list is in reverse order.
Space Complexity: O(1) - In-place sorting.

Quick Sort:
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n) - When the pivot divides the array into approximately equal halves.
Average Case: O(n log n) - Typically efficient in practice with good pivot selection.
Worst Case: O(n^2) - When the pivot is the smallest or largest element.
Space Complexity: O(log n) - Due to recursion stack.

Discuss why Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort.
Efficiency:
Time Complexity: Quick Sort generally performs much faster than Bubble Sort, especially for large datasets, due to its O(n log n) average-case time complexity compared to Bubble Sort’s O(n^2). Quick Sort’s divide-and-conquer approach efficiently narrows down the search space.
Scalability: Quick Sort scales better with larger datasets due to its logarithmic growth in time complexity. Bubble Sort’s quadratic growth leads to poor performance as the dataset size increases.

Practical Performance:
Implementation Details: Despite its worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), Quick Sort’s practical performance is often superior to Bubble Sort due to better average-case performance and lower overhead. Techniques like random pivoting or median-of-three can improve Quick Sort’s worst-case performance.

Flexibility:
Data Handling: Quick Sort can handle various data distributions more effectively than Bubble Sort. While Bubble Sort is simple, it’s not suitable for large or unsorted datasets where Quick Sort’s efficiency shines.

Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort for most practical applications due to its superior average-case performance and efficiency with large datasets. Bubble Sort, while simple, is often used for educational purposes or small datasets where its simplicity is an advantage.
