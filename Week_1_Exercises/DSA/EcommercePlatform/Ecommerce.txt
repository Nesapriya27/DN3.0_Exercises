Step 1: Understand Asymptotic Notation\
Big O Notation:
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It gives an idea of the worst-case scenario in terms of 
performance and helps in understanding how an algorithm scales with the input size.
For example, O(n) means the running time increases linearly with the input size, while O(log n) means the running time increases logarithmically

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations
Best Case: The scenario where the search operation completes in the least amount of time. For example, in a linear search, finding the target element at the first position.
Average Case: The expected time for the search operation over all possible inputs. It represents the expected performance of the algorithm.
Worst Case: The scenario where the search operation takes the maximum amount of time. For example, in a linear search, not finding the element or finding it at the last position
