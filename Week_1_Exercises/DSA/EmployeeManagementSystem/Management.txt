1.	Understand Linked Lists:
Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).

Array Representation in Memory:
Contiguous Memory Allocation:
Arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory. This means that all elements of the array are placed next to each other in a linear sequence. This allocation allows for constant-time access to any element using an index.

Index-Based Access:
Accessing elements in an array is done through indices. For example, array[i] gives direct access to the element at position i. This results in O(1) time complexity for access operations.

Fixed Size:
Once an array is created, its size is fixed and cannot be changed. This can lead to inefficiencies if the number of elements changes frequently.

Advantages:
Efficiency: Fast access to elements due to contiguous memory allocation and direct indexing.
Simplicity: Arrays are straightforward to implement and use, making them easy to understand and manage for basic operations.

Disadvantages:
Fixed Size: Limited flexibility as the size must be defined at the time of creation.
Inserting and Deleting: Inefficient for operations that involve inserting or deleting elements since it may require shifting elements to maintain contiguous memory.

4.	Analysis:
Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
Time Complexity of Operations:
Add Employee:
Time Complexity: O(1) - Inserting at the end of the array is constant time, assuming there's space available. If the array is full, resizing would be required, which can be O(n).

Search Employee:
Time Complexity: O(n) - Searching through the array requires a linear scan of elements.

Traverse Employees:
Time Complexity: O(n) - Traversing through the array requires visiting each element.

Delete Employee:
Time Complexity: O(n) - Finding the employee requires a linear scan, and shifting elements to fill the gap also takes linear time.

Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.

Fixed Size:
Arrays have a fixed size, which limits flexibility. If the number of employees changes frequently, a dynamic data structure like ArrayList or LinkedList would be more appropriate.

Insertion and Deletion Efficiency:
Arrays are not efficient for insertion and deletion operations compared to other data structures. If these operations are frequent, using a LinkedList or a dynamic array (like ArrayList in Java) is better.

Memory Utilization:
Arrays can waste memory if the allocated size is much larger than the number of elements actually stored. Dynamic arrays (like ArrayList) can grow and shrink as needed.

When to Use Arrays:
Arrays are suitable when the number of elements is known ahead of time and remains relatively constant, or when high performance for access operations is required and the dataset is not frequently modified. For small or simple use cases, arrays provide simplicity and efficiency. For more complex scenarios with dynamic datasets, other data structures might be more appropriate.
