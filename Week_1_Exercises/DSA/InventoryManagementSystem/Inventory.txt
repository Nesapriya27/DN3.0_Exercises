Inventory Management System
Step 1:
Understanding the problem:
1.Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
  
  Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial for handling large inventories as they ensure compact storage and quick access to data like product IDs, names,
  quantities, and locations. They allow efficient manipulation of data, such as searching, updating, adding, and removing items, ensuring system responsiveness.
  As the inventory grows, scalable data structures and algorithms prevent performance bottlenecks, maintaining warehouse efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
  They also maintain data integrity and consistency, especially with concurrent access by multiple users or systems. Optimized operations reduce time complexity, 
  improving overall performance, while effective memory management prevents excessive memory consumption, allowing the system to handle large data volumes smoothly.
  Additionally, these structures support real-time analytics and reporting, enabling better decision-making and inventory control. They also facilitate efficient 
  handling of bulk operations, such as batch updates and automated reorder processes, enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability.

2.Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
ArrayList: Useful for maintaining an ordered collection of items where the size can change dynamically. They provide fast access and update times for indexed
elements, making them ideal for situations where the size of the inventory frequently changes.
Linked Lists: Useful when frequent insertions and deletions are needed. Each item (node) contains a reference to the next item, making it easy to add or remove 
items without shifting elements, which is beneficial for maintaining inventory logs or transaction histories.
Hash Tables:
HashMap: Provides fast access, insertion, and deletion times (average O(1) complexity) by using a hash function to map keys (e.g., product IDs) to values
(e.g., product details). Ideal for scenarios where quick lookups are needed, such as checking stock levels or retrieving product details, ensuring efficient
inventory management and minimal search times
Trees:
Binary Search Trees (BST): Allow for ordered storage and efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Balanced trees (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees) 
ensure O(log n) complexity for these operations, making them suitable for maintaining sorted inventories and supporting range queries and ordered traversals.

3.Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
Chosen Data Structure: HashMap
Add Operation:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: Inserting a product into a HashMap involves computing the hash code of the key (productId) and placing the entry in the appropriate bucket. On average, this operation takes constant time, assuming the hash function distributes keys uniformly across buckets. However, in the worst case (e.g., all keys hash to the same bucket), the time complexity can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of entries.

Update Operation:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: Updating a product involves retrieving the product by its key (productId) and then updating its attributes. The retrieval operation takes constant time on average, and updating the attributes is also a constant-time operation. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(1) on average. Again, in the worst case, it can degrade to O(n) if the hash function does not distribute keys well.

Delete Operation:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: Deleting a product involves locating the entry by its key (productId) and removing it from the HashMap. On average, both the retrieval and removal operations take constant time. In the worst case, the time complexity can degrade to O(n) if many keys hash to the same bucket.

4.Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
Optimal Load Factor:
Maintaining an optimal load factor ensures that the HashMap does not become too full, which helps maintain O(1) time complexity for most operations. If the load factor exceeds this threshold, the HashMap automatically resizes (usually doubling its capacity), redistributing the entries across a larger number of buckets.

Hash Function:
A good hash function ensures that keys are evenly distributed across the buckets, minimizing the chances of collisions. This helps maintain the average case time complexity of O(1) for insertions, updates, and deletions.

Resizing:
When resizing the HashMap (rehashing all entries), it's important to ensure this operation is efficient. Although resizing has a time complexity of O(n), it happens infrequently,and the cost is amortized over multiple insertions.

Concurrent Access:
For multi-threaded applications, using ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashMap can help manage concurrent access efficiently. ConcurrentHashMap uses finer-grained locking, reducing contention and improving throughput for concurrent operations.
