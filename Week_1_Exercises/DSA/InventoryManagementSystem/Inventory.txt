Inventory Management System
Step 1:
Understanding the problem:
1.Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
  
  Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial for handling large inventories as they ensure compact storage and quick access to data like product IDs, names,
  quantities, and locations. They allow efficient manipulation of data, such as searching, updating, adding, and removing items, ensuring system responsiveness.
  As the inventory grows, scalable data structures and algorithms prevent performance bottlenecks, maintaining warehouse efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
  They also maintain data integrity and consistency, especially with concurrent access by multiple users or systems. Optimized operations reduce time complexity, 
  improving overall performance, while effective memory management prevents excessive memory consumption, allowing the system to handle large data volumes smoothly.
  Additionally, these structures support real-time analytics and reporting, enabling better decision-making and inventory control. They also facilitate efficient 
  handling of bulk operations, such as batch updates and automated reorder processes, enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability.

2.Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
ArrayList: Useful for maintaining an ordered collection of items where the size can change dynamically. They provide fast access and update times for indexed
elements, making them ideal for situations where the size of the inventory frequently changes.
Linked Lists: Useful when frequent insertions and deletions are needed. Each item (node) contains a reference to the next item, making it easy to add or remove 
items without shifting elements, which is beneficial for maintaining inventory logs or transaction histories.
Hash Tables:
HashMap: Provides fast access, insertion, and deletion times (average O(1) complexity) by using a hash function to map keys (e.g., product IDs) to values
(e.g., product details). Ideal for scenarios where quick lookups are needed, such as checking stock levels or retrieving product details, ensuring efficient
inventory management and minimal search times
Trees:
Binary Search Trees (BST): Allow for ordered storage and efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Balanced trees (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees) 
ensure O(log n) complexity for these operations, making them suitable for maintaining sorted inventories and supporting range queries and ordered traversals.
